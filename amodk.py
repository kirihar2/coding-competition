Find all pairs (a, b) in an array such that a % b = k
Given an array with distinct elements, the task is to find the pairs in the array such that a % b = k, where k is a given integer.

Examples :

Input  :  arr[] = {2, 3, 5, 4, 7}   
              k = 3
Output :  (7, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7)
7 % 4 = 3
3 % 4 = 3
3 % 5 = 3
3 % 7 = 3
'''


arr= [2, 3, 5, 4, 7]  
k = 3
