sharding scheme for key value storage


what is the amount of data we need to store
few 100TB

how frequent does the data grow each day
1TB per day

what do the storage machines specs look like?
RAM 72GB disk capacity 10TB

how many machine is available 
20

are all key value entries independent?
yes



at least 10 machines for pure disk capacity
which would mean we have 720GB of memorya

how frequently would we need to add machines, 
every 8 days if we want storage utilization of 80%

no we cannot have  afixed number of shards because one requirement for a shard is that it fits in one machine

how many shards do we have and how do we distribute the data within the shard
simple sharding will hash H and shard will be hash%#shards
but as soon as we add an extra shard we would need to recalculate the hash and relocate each key
very costly 

better sharding strategy:
consistent hashing
